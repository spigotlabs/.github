# Hello!

Spigot Labs was a venture championed by Scott Vitale from August 2015 until March 2020. I set out to change the way people attend beer, wine, and food festivals - giving each fan a comprehensive experience memory with just a tap. I built many things along the way and in support of this vision including:

* Fast, efficient event check-in
* On-demand badge printing and provisioning
* Embedded RFID technology on every tasting glass
* Native apps for real-time engagement
* An extensive corpus of marketing data, consumer preferences, and attendee sentiment

In the wake of the global COVID19 pandemic, the market for live events went to zero overnight. After 6 months with no events, I made the difficult decision to close Spigot Labs and trade in the "founder" title for my old, comfortable engineering shoes. Although closing a business often feels like failure, I'm incredibly grateful for the people who helped me along the way. I grew as an engineer, a salesperson, a project manager, and most importantly as a person. I couldn't have made it nearly this far without each and every one of you:

* Kate Vitale
* Ryan Evans
* Megan VonWald
* Lorin Ting
* Elizabeth Glau
* Aaron Stillwell
* Fletcher Richman
* John Wilker
* Sonya Pritchard
* Meagan Logan
* Adina Johnson
* Alia Pialtos

Thank you, sincerely.

Finally, a few pieces of nostalgia for Spigot Labs and the ride it was:
